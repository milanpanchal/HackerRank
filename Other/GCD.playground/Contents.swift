/*:
 # Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
 
 ---
 GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors.
 
 ```
 36     = 2 x 2 x 3 x 3
 60     = 2 x 2 x 3 x 5
 
 GCD    = Multiplication of common factor
        = 2 x 2 x 3
        = 12
 ```

 The algorithm is based on below facts.
 
 + If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
 + Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
